            <h1>About Indian Wrestling Heritage</h1>
            <p>Welcome to a digital celebration of India's rich wrestling tradition. This curated platform showcases the
                legendary wrestlers, traditional akhadas, and the evolution of Indian wrestling from ancient times to
                modern Olympic glory.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We are dedicated to preserving and sharing the stories of India's wrestling heroes. From the traditional
                mud arenas of village akhadas to the international wrestling mats, our mission is to honor the legacy of
                wrestlers who have brought pride to the nation.</p>

            <h2>The Art of Indian Wrestling</h2>
            <p>Indian wrestling, known as "Pehlwani" or "Kushti," is more than just a sport—it's a way of life. Rooted
                in ancient traditions, it emphasizes discipline, respect, and the holistic development of mind, body,
                and spirit. The traditional akhada serves not just as a training ground, but as a cultural institution
                that has preserved these values for centuries.</p>

            <h2>Join Our Community</h2>
            <p>Whether you're a wrestling enthusiast, a student of Indian culture, or someone interested in sports
                history, we invite you to explore these stories and contribute to our growing archive. Share your own
                stories, photos, or knowledge to help us build a comprehensive resource for future generations.</p>
