      <h1>Chandgi Ram (1937–2010)</h1>

      <p>
        Known affectionately as <strong>Guru Chandgi Ram</strong>, he was one of India’s most celebrated wrestlers and a
        pioneer who brought women into the wrestling arena.
        Born on November 9, 1937, in Sisai village, Hisar district of Haryana, Chandgi Ram rose from a humble farming
        background to become the symbol of Indian wrestling’s strength and reform.
      </p>

      <h2>Early Life & Background</h2>
      <p>
        Chandgi Ram grew up in rural Haryana, where wrestling was both a tradition and a measure of honor.
        He began formal training at the age of 20 — relatively late for the sport — yet his natural strength,
        determination, and discipline quickly made him a champion in village <em>akhadas</em>.
        Initially serving in the Indian Army, he later dedicated himself completely to wrestling, training under
        traditional gurus in the soil pits of north India.
      </p>

      <h2>Wrestling Career & Achievements</h2>
      <ul class="achievement-list">
        <li>Won the <strong>Gold Medal</strong> in the 90 kg category at the <strong>1970 Asian Games</strong> in
          Bangkok — India’s only wrestling gold at the event.</li>
        <li>Represented India at the <strong>1972 Munich Olympics</strong>.</li>
        <li>Recipient of the <strong>Arjuna Award</strong> in 1971 for outstanding performance in sports.</li>
        <li>Honored with the <strong>Padma Shri</strong> in 1972 for his contribution to Indian wrestling.</li>
        <li>Multiple-time <strong>National Champion</strong> and celebrated as one of the toughest competitors of his
          generation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Training Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Chandgi Ram’s training reflected a fusion of raw physical intensity and moral discipline.
        He emphasized a lifestyle rooted in simplicity — early rising, long hours of <em>dands</em> and
        <em>bethaks</em>, and a pure vegetarian diet focused on milk, ghee, almonds, and fruits.
        For him, wrestling was not merely a sport but a way to cultivate courage, patience, and respect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even as he transitioned into coaching, he maintained that “<em>A wrestler must first conquer his habits before
          he conquers his opponents.</em>”
        His students recall his strict yet inspiring mentorship and his unyielding belief in traditional Indian values
        of self-control and humility.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Women’s Wrestling</h2>
      <p>
        Chandgi Ram broke barriers in a deeply traditional sport by becoming the <strong>first Indian coach to train
          women wrestlers</strong>.
        Facing criticism and even hostility, he remained steadfast in his mission to open wrestling to women.
        His daughters — <strong>Sonika Kaliraman</strong> and <strong>Deepika Kaliraman</strong> — became national
        champions under his guidance, paving the way for future stars like <strong>Geeta Phogat</strong> and
        <strong>Babita Phogat</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        His <strong>Guru Hanuman Akhada</strong> in Delhi became a cradle for countless wrestling champions, male and
        female alike, producing Olympians and Commonwealth medalists.
        This legacy earned him the enduring title “Guru ji” among wrestlers across India.
      </p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond medals and records, Chandgi Ram’s impact lies in how he transformed the culture of Indian wrestling.
        His advocacy for women wrestlers changed the perception of the sport in India forever.
        He is revered as a reformer who turned his personal victories into a collective awakening for gender equality in
        wrestling.

        wrestling heritage.

      <blockquote>

        <em>akhada</em> soil as her brother.”
