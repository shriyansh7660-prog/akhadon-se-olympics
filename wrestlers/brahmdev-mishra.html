            <h1>Brahmdev Mishra (1917–1975)</h1>

            <p>
                Born in Kartika month, 1917, in Khajani (near Bansgaon-tehsil), Gorakhpur district (Uttar Pradesh),
                Brahmdev Mishra hailed from a family steeped in the traditional Indian wrestling (akhāda/pehlwān)
                culture.
                Inspired by his father Mahadev Mishra and elder brothers, he entered the ring at the age of seven and
                trained at the famed Pakkibagh akhada in Gorakhpur under guru Chandan Singh of Kashmir.
            </p>

            <h2>Early Life & Background</h2>
            <p>
                Coming from a Brahmin family known in local akhada circles, his formal education ended by middle-school,
                but he had an aptitude for Sanskrit verses and the Ramayana.
                Starting his wrestling training in the soil pits (mitti) of his home village akhada, he quickly gained
                reputation for strength, stamina and traditional wrestling technique.
            </p>

            <h2>Wrestling Career & Achievements</h2>
            <ul class="achievement-list">
                <li>At a peak fan-reported body weight of around 120 kg (264 lbs) and height of approx. 5′6″, his
                    physical prowess was often highlighted in contemporary accounts.</li>
                <li>Trained with high volume routines: reportedly 2,500 squats and 1,500 push-ups in 45 minutes followed
                    by practice bouts (jor) with up to 50 rivals.</li>
                <li>Mastered traditional pehlwani techniques such as nikāl, tang, multānī, dhank and puthi.</li>
                <li>Notably defeated the legendary Dara Singh (of Punjab) in a city-duel match held at Dharmatala
                    Maidan, Calcutta, in 1951.</li>
                <li>Defeated international opponents as well: one cited match is against Romanian wrestler George
                    Constantine in Gorakhpur.</li>
                <li>Earned reputation with the epithet “Lion of India” for his dominance in Indian akhada wrestling.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Training Philosophy & Style</h2>
            <p>
                Brahmdev Mishra believed that wrestling (kushti/pehlwani) was more than a physical contest — it was a
                spiritual and ethical discipline, combining mind, body and character.
                His daily regimen began before dawn with prayers and meditation, followed by high-intensity body-weight
                exercises, then traditional akhada bouts on mud pits.
                He insisted on simplicity in diet and strict discipline, following the traditional akhada rules: no
                alcohol, focus on milk, ghee, almonds and sprouted legume snacks.
            </p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                His influence continues through the Mishra family of wrestlers from Gorakhpur, including his nephew Ram
                Narayan Mishra and grandson Chandraprakash “Maha Gama” Mishra, who represented India abroad.
                His dedication to the traditional akhada system during a period of transition in Indian pehlwani helped
                preserve the old-school ethos of the sport.
                He is remembered in lists of great Indian pehlwani wrestlers alongside names such as The Great Gama and
                Dara Singh.

            <h2>Personal Life & Later Years</h2>
            <p>
                Brahmdev Mishra was known to live a simple and disciplined life outside the akhada. He married and had
                children, and his family continued his wrestling legacy through subsequent generations.
                Even after retiring from active competition, he remained deeply involved in mentoring young wrestlers in
                Gorakhpur, often traveling to regional tournaments to coach and judge matches.
                Mishra passed away in 1975, leaving behind a revered name in Indian wrestling and a strong tradition of
                pehlwani that his family and students continue to uphold.
